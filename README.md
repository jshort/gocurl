# gocurl [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jshort/gocurl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jshort/gocurl)
Http client in golang

My goals are to:
- Learn Go
- Make a curl-like go executable with the feature set that folks use 95% of the time with curl, namely a lightweight http client cli tool.
- Bash/zsh completion scripts?
- Well organized and colorful console output

## Testing
- Travis CI
- Unit tests

## Usage
Given my second goal above, I don't intend to go terribly in-depth into a usage explanation.  Given my usages of [goopt](https://github.com/droundy/goopt), the <code>--help</code> menu of the executable should be all the explanation one needs.
